# :sparkles: What is Basecamp?
Basecamp is the selection process of 42 São Paulo, It is an immersive 20-day training, which takes place virtually through Discord. In this immersion, all people who participate will experience the learning method and culture of 42 in practice.

# :pushpin: Note
The exercises included in this repository were refactored and performed after my entry into 42, I decided to redo the lists that I did not perform during basecamp for training purposes, during basecamp I only performed up to list C04.
Shell lists are not included in this repository.

The exercises included here have not been corrected by Moulliette
